#Influence Of Opynion Dynamics on Disease Spread

in this project we have seen so far that how different opinion can influence the infection spread rate, more the fear impying opnions having  negative values will take more precautions and as the opinion values increases to 0 (implying fearlessness) then my infection will be the highest, we do so  by defining de√≠fferential equations and then solve them using Numerical Analysis methods. the plotting curves using matplotlib. 

Later on we will compare this model with standard SIR and then will try to optimize the Infection and recovery rate, so that it could fit the model with opinion dynamics. In the end we will take some dataset of values of infection and recovery rate and then see for which values my fitting model fits the best
