# Project Overview

## Exploring the Influence of Opinion Dynamics on Infectious Diseases Spread

This project aims to bridge the gap between epidemiological modeling and social behavior analysis by extending the classic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. Traditionally, the SIR model divides the population into three categories to predict the course of an epidemic. However, this model does not account for the influence of public opinion and social behavior, which are critical in understanding real-world disease spread.

### Key Features of the Project:
- **Enhanced SIR Model**: We've developed a modified version of the SIR model that incorporates opinion dynamics. This allows us to simulate how people's opinions, influenced by social networks, media, and public health messages, can alter their behavior and consequently, the dynamics of disease transmission.
  
- **Markov Chains & Transition Matrices**: The project uses Markov chains and transition matrices to simulate the transitions between different states (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) while factoring in changes in public opinion.
  
- **Parameter Optimization**: We applied optimization techniques to fit the model parameters. This ensures that our simulations closely mirror actual epidemic scenarios, improving the accuracy and applicability of the model.
  

### Conclusion:
The project underscores the importance of integrating social dynamics into epidemiological models. By considering how public opinion can influence individual behavior, we provide a more holistic view of disease spread, offering valuable insights for public health strategies in managing pandemics.
