# Project Overview

This project explores the influence of opinion dynamics on the spread of infectious diseases using an enhanced SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. Traditional SIR models categorize populations into three compartments to model disease spread. We have extended this model by integrating opinion dynamics, reflecting how individuals' opinions—shaped by social networks and media—affect their behavior and interactions, which in turn influences disease propagation. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how behavioral changes and public opinion interplay with epidemiological dynamics.

Key components include:
- A modified SIR model incorporating opinion dynamics.
- Use of Markov chains and transition matrices to simulate state changes.
- Optimization techniques for parameter fitting to better align the model with real-world data.

The results demonstrate how varying rates of infection, recovery, and opinion change can impact the spread of diseases like COVID-19, highlighting the importance of considering both biological and social factors in epidemiological modeling.
